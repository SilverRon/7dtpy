This repository contains all useful codes to process or analyze the data from the 7-Dimensional Telescope (7DT). The first version 0.1 is for the research to figure out how the 7DT is powerful to identify the kilonova (KN) with medium-bands spectral energy distribution (SED) in single epoch among detected various transients during GW optical follow-up observations. *Maybe* the later versions will contain more various functions to deal with the 7DT data.
